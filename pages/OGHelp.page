Each section contains several statements along with the questions defining each statement. At the end of each section you will find a High, Medium, or Low rating of the overall section. At the end of the tool, you will find a Combined Buy Potential score. The estimate is based on scores you assign to each statement accordingly to what you know about the opportunity." />
